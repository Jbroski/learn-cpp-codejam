/*
Input: The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, C. C lines follow. Each starts with a single integer N, which is followed by a space and then N space-separated integers ti, the number of slarboseconds since Great Event i occurred.
*/

/*
Output: For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the case number (starting from 1) and y is the minimum number of slarboseconds until ti + y is a multiple of the largest possible integer factor T for all i.
